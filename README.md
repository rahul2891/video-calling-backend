I built a video call app using WebRTC for real-time peer-to-peer media transmission and Socket.IO for signaling. When a user joins a room, the backend (Node + Express + Socket.IO) manages the room membership. On the frontend, I use React with Context API to manage socket state. When a user joins, the server emits the list of participants and notifies others. WebRTC calls are then established between peers, and video streams are shown using the <video> element. The app supports dynamic joining and leaving of users in real-time.
